abstract = {Bodily behavioral language is an important social cue, and its automated analysis helps in enhancing the understanding of artificial intelligence systems. Furthermore, behavioral language cues are essential for active engagement in social agent-based user interactions. Despite the progress made in computer vision for tasks like head and body pose estimation, there is still a need to explore the detection of finer behaviors such as gesturing, grooming, or fumbling. This paper proposes a multiview attention fusion method named MAGIC-TBR that combines features extracted from videos and their corresponding Discrete Cosine Transform coefficients via a transformer-based approach. The experiments are conducted on the BBSI dataset and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed feature fusion with multiview attention. The code is available at: https://github.com/surbhimadan92/MAGIC-TBR},

abstract = {The objective of this project was to work on the different aspects of periodic spatio-temporal hotspots in Microsoft Azure Services. Without millions of users using Azure APIs, it becomes necessary to track usage spikes and perform neces- sary configuration changes in the servers to handle large number of requests. We thus implemented algorithms to process usage data from Azure services to return periodic usage spikes.
The first part of this report involves the implementation and experiments based on the Mono-Chromatic Spatio-Temporal Hotspot algorithm, proposed by Gunturi et al. [2022]. We add several modules to the same, modify the framework, and run experiments to verify its performance.
The second part involves design, implementation and experiments based on the novel Multi-Chromatic Spatio-Temporal Hotspot algorithm. We discuss the problem formulation, the design and implementation of the algorithm.},

abstract="This paper describes a novel Android Wear OS application, designed to enable researchers to conveniently collect sensor data from commonly available Wear OS smartwatches for dataset generation. The application was primarily developed to ensure the reliability of data collection during physical exercises. The application thus proposed implements a reliable dataset generation architecture, which researchers can extend and modify to adapt to their workflows. In the application, data is collected from sensors present on the smartwatch and then transferred to a paired smartphone. Thus, the application eliminates the need for a third device or service (such as cloud storage) for dataset generation. Data obtained from the smartwatch is stored in a predetermined folder/directory in the smartphone in CSV format making it convenient for performing data analysis. The application is tested by recording data from multiple subjects in the lab environment as well as outside the lab. The quality of data was confirmed by plotting it in normal working time, and during physical exercise and the changes are properly observed, which ensures that the data we are collecting is correct. Since the use of smartwatches has become prevalent for studying and diagnosing diseases, the application will be very useful for researchers across the globe for creating datasets for biomedical research.",
