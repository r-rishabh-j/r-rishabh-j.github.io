I am a robotics and artificial intelligence enthusiast. I will be joining Columbia University for a Master's in Computer Science in Fall 2025. My research interests are in deep learning, computer vision and robotics, and currently looking for research opportunities.

I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology Ropar in 2023 with a BTech Honors in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence.

During my leisure time, you can find me in the badminton court üè∏ or playing the guitar üé∏.
