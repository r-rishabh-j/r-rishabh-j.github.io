A robotics and artificial intelligence enthusiast, I will be joining Columbia University for a Master's in Computer Science in Fall 2025. My research interests are in theoretical ML, deep learning based computer vision and robotics, and am currently looking for research opportunities.

I graduated from IIT Ropar in 2023 with a BTech Honors in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, where I worked on projects in computer vision, reinforcement learning and federated learning.

During my leisure time, you can find me in the badminton court üè∏ or playing the guitar üé∏.
