I am a robotics and artificial intelligence enthusiast. I will be joining Columbia University for a Master's in Computer Science in Fall 2025. My research interests and background primarily revolves around computer vision, and am looking for research opportunities for the same!

I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology Ropar in 2023 with a BTech Honors in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. I recently started exploring natural language processing, and am working on some cool projects!

During my leisure time, you can find me in the badminton court üè∏ or playing the guitar üé∏.
