Hi! I am an MS in Computer Science student at Columbia University in the Machine Learning track. My research interests span deep learning theory, computer vision and robotics.

Currently, I am working in collaboration with IBM at Columbia for benchmarking IT automation AI Agents in [ITBench](https://github.com/itbench-hub).

I graduated from IIT Ropar in 2023 with a BTech Honors in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, where I worked on computer vision, reinforcement learning and federated learning.
