I am a Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence enthusiast. My research interests primarily revolve around Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning. 

I love playing the guitar 🎸, and closely follow the latest space tech 🚀 developments in the world. In my free time, you can find me in the badminton court 🏸 or the gym 💪🏼.
