I am a robotics and artificial intelligence enthusiast. An Indian Institute of Technology Ropar graduate with a Bachelor's in Computer Science with an Honors in Artificial Intelligence, my research interests primarily revolve around computer vision and robotics.
I recently started exploring natural language processing and am working on some cool projects!

I love playing the guitar 🎸, and closely follow the latest space tech 🚀 developments in the world. Hit me up to engage in an endless discussion on space exploration!

During my leisure time, you can find me in the badminton court 🏸
