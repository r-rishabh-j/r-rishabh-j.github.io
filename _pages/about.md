I am a robotics and artificial intelligence enthusiast. An Indian Institute of Technology Ropar graduate with a BTech Honors in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, my research interests primarily revolve around computer vision.

I recently started exploring natural language processing, and am working on some cool projects!
During my leisure time, you can find me in the badminton court 🏸 or playing the guitar 🎸.
