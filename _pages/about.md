Hi! I am an MS in Computer Science student at Columbia University in the Machine Learning track. My research interests span efficient model inference, computer vision and robotics. I am in the market for Summer 2026 internships in Software Engineering and Machine Learning!

I am currently exploring LLM distillation and speculative decoding for efficient inference. I am also working in collaboration with IBM at Columbia for benchmarking IT automation AI Agents in [ITBench](https://github.com/itbench-hub).

I graduated from IIT Ropar in 2023 with a BTech Honors in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence.
