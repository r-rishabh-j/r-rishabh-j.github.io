I am a robotics and artificial intelligence enthusiast. I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology Ropar with a Bachlor's in Computer Science with an Honors in Artificial Intelligence. My research interests primarily revolve around computer vision, robotics and federated learning. 
I recently started exploring natural language processing and am working on some cool projects!

I love playing the guitar 🎸, and closely follow the latest space tech 🚀 developments in the world. Hit me up to engage in an endless discussion on space exploration!

During my leisure time, you can find me in the badminton court 🏸
