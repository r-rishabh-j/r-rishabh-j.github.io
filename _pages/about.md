Hi! I'm an MS in Computer Science student at Columbia University in the Machine Learning track. My research interests span **efficient model inference, computer vision and robotics.** I'm currently working on **distillation and speculative decoding** for efficient inference in LLMs and VLMs. I am also in collaboration with IBM at Columbia for benchmarking IT automation AI Agents in [ITBench](https://github.com/itbench-hub).

I am currently seeking Summer 2026 internships in Software Engineering and Machine Learning!

I graduated from IIT Ropar in 2023 with a BTech Honors in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. I then worked as a software engineer at Arista Networks on high-throughput network OS and build systems.
