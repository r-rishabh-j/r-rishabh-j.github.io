I am a Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence enthusiast. I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology Ropar with a Bachlor's in Computer Science with an Honors in Artificial Intelligence. My research interests primarily revolve around Computer Vision and Federated Learning. I am currently working on some cool projects in the domain of Natural Language Processing.

I love playing the guitar 🎸, and closely follow the latest space tech 🚀 developments in the world. During my leisure time, you can find me in the badminton court 🏸 or the gym 💪🏼.
