I'm an MS Computer Science student at Columbia University in the Machine Learning track. My research interests lie at the intersection of efficient model inference, computer vision, and robotics.

Currently, I'm exploring distillation and speculative decoding techniques to accelerate inference in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). I'm advised by Prof. Matei Ciocarlie at the Columbia ROAM Lab, where I work on foundation models and reinforcement learning for robotic manipulation. I'm also collaborating with IBM Research to benchmark AI agents for IT automation through the open-source [ITBench](https://github.com/itbench-hub) project.

Before Columbia, I graduated with a B.Tech (Honors) in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence from IIT Ropar in 2023. I then worked as a Software Engineer at Arista Networks, contributing to high-throughput network operating systems and build infrastructure.

I'm actively seeking **Summer 2026 internships** in Machine Learning or Software Engineering roles. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about efficient inference, robotics, or anything in between!
