A robotics and artificial intelligence enthusiast, I am currently pursuing Master's in Computer Science at Columbia University. My research interests are in theoretical ML, deep learning based computer vision and robotics.

I graduated from IIT Ropar in 2023 with a BTech Honors in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, where I worked on computer vision, reinforcement learning and federated learning.

I enjoy playing badminton, and follow the World Endurance Championship (WEC) closely!
I also play the guitar - primarily solos.
